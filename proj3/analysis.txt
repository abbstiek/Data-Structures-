The complexity of resizing a vector to zero is linear in the number 
of elements currently stored in the vector. Setting vector's size to 
zero offers no real advantage over calling clear() - the two are 
basically the same.

However, the implementation gives you an O(1) complexity for primitive types by 
employing partial template specialization.
